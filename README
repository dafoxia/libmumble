What is libmumble?
==================

libmumble is an attempt at writing a cross-platform C++ library for
implementing Mumble clients. The initial client of libmumble is
MumbleKit, the Objective-C Mumble framework for iOS and Mac OS X.

Building libmumble on Unix-like systems
=======================================

To build libmumble and run its test suite (the only application
that's really worth running right now), you can use the test.bash
script in the root of the source tree.

Running the test.bash script is simple:

 $ ./test.bash

This will generate build scripts suitable for your environment (Ninja,
Make or an Xcode project on Macs). It'll perform a build and execute
the libmumble-test binary, which runs the libmumble test suite.

Building libmumble for Android
==============================

It's possible to build libmumble for Android. Currently,
the only thing that really runs is the libmumble-test executable.

Can you use the library in an app? Probably. But I don't know
how to hook it up. Feel free to contribute, if this is something
you need urgently.

To build and test, run:
 $ ./test.bash libmumble-test android
from the root of the source tree.

This will build and run (via adb) the libmumble-test executable
on a conneted Android device. You should probably only have a
single device connected at a time for this to work - the script
isn't too considerate of other scenarios.

Prerequisites
-------------

Running the libmumble-test binary on Android requires a device with
a /usr/bin/su binary installed, allowing the test.bash script to gain
root privileges in order to mount a tmpfs file system on which the
libmumble test data and test executable will live and execute from.

The test.bash script also expects that you have the
<ANDROID_SDK>/platform-tools and <ANDROID_NDK> paths in your PATH
environment variable.
